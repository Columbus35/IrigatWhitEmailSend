In this project, I have created a functional irrigation system.
The system includes four moisture sensors, two pumps, and four valves.
Each pump is connected to two valves.

Twice a day, the system checks whether the soil moisture is too low.
If this is the case, the corresponding pump and its associated valve are activated.

The four valves divide the irrigation system into four separate sections, allowing each section to be watered individually.

Additionally, an email is sent twice a day with the measurement results from the four moisture sensors.
